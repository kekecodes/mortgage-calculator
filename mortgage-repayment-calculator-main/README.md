## Mortgage Calculator Webpage - README

This project implements a mortgage calculator webpage with a user-friendly interface and responsive design.

**Getting Started**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the calculator.

**Functionality**

* Users can enter their mortgage amount, term (in years), and interest rate.
* The calculator validates user input (checks for numeric values).
* Upon clicking the "Calculate Repayments" button, the script calculates the monthly mortgage payment and total mortgage repayment based on the provided information.
* The calculated results are displayed within the webpage.
* The layout adapts to different screen sizes using responsive design techniques.

**Technologies Used**

* HTML: Defines the basic structure of the webpage.
* CSS: Styles the visual design and layout, including responsiveness.
* JavaScript: Adds interactivity and functionality for calculations, form validation, and result display.
* DOM Manipulation: JavaScript techniques to access and modify HTML elements.
* Event Listeners: JavaScript technique for detecting user interactions (button click).

**Project Structure**

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the webpage structure.
* `style.css`: Stylesheets defining the visual design and responsiveness.
* `script.js`: JavaScript code for form validation, calculations, and result display.

**Further Development**

* Implement additional mortgage types with specific calculations.
* Enhance error handling for invalid user input (beyond numeric values).
* Integrate unit tests for the JavaScript functions to ensure code reliability.

**Feedback and Contributions**

We welcome suggestions for improving the user experience, adding features, or enhancing the code structure. Feel free to create pull requests or raise issues on this repository.
